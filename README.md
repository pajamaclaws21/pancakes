1) go to cohere.ai
2) click on "TRY NOW" in upper right hand corner of site
3) sign up w/ google or github or w/ email
4) in the left-hand menu, click on "API Keys" (right beneath "Billing & Usage")
5) scroll down and click on "New Trial key"
6) type in a name and click on "Generate Trial Key"
7) copy the key. it will stay on this dashboard so you can copy it in the future

## stuff i want
so i'm working on adding a project and this stuff will all be there, but here's the gist:
- looping tile background of pancakes (vector?)
- a different font/more fonts
- more detailed prompt customization (see [the current system](##advanced prompt stuff))

## advanced prompt stuff
the prompt template this app uses is as follows: <br>
`Generate a short but detailed [FIC-TYPE] fanfic about [REL-TYPE], and describe the situation they are in.`
